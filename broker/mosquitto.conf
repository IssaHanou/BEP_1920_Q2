# Config file for mosquitto


# =================================================================
# Default listener
# =================================================================

# IP address/hostname to bind the default listener to. If not
# given, the default listener will not be bound to a specific
# address and so will be accessible to all network interfaces.
# bind_address ip-address/host name
bind_address localhost

# Port to use for the default listener.
port 1883

# Choose the protocol to use when listening.
# This can be either mqtt or websockets.
# Websockets support is currently disabled by default at compile time.
# Certificate based TLS may be used with websockets, except that
# only the cafile, certfile, keyfile and ciphers options are supported.
protocol mqtt 


# =================================================================
# Extra listeners
# =================================================================

# Listen on a port/ip address combination. By using this variable
# multiple times, mosquitto can listen on more than one port. If
# this variable is used and neither bind_address nor port given,
# then the default listener will not be started.
# The port number to listen on must be given. Optionally, an ip
# address or host name may be supplied as a second argument. In
# this case, mosquitto will attempt to bind the listener to that
# address and so restrict access to the associated network and
# interface. By default, mosquitto will listen on all interfaces.
# Note that for a websockets listener it is not possible to bind to a host
# name.
# listener port-number [ip address/host name]
listener 8083

# Choose the protocol to use when listening.
# This can be either mqtt or websockets.
# Certificate based TLS may be used with websockets, except that only the
# cafile, certfile, keyfile and ciphers options are supported.
