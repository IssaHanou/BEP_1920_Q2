# Project structure
`index.html` is the main html file that is generated. This includes app-root. 
In `app.component.html` the main app is described, which includes multiple components. 
These are included by a `<app-componentname>` tag, and are generated by the files in componentname package in `components`.

The `name.component.html` file generates html, `name.component.css` adds css to this html. 
`name.component.ts` manages this component, this the place to define additional imports (all files use `src/assets/css/main.css`) and parameters. 
These parameters can used in the html file with: `{{ parameter }}`. Finally, `name.component.spec.ts` tests this specific component, using Karma.
